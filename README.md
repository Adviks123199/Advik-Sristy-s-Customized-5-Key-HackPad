I created this 5-key macropad, which features an ergonomic layout for fingers to reach the keys with ease. It also features a status LED, along with a capacitor.

Challenges:
I had a difficult time with the proportions and getting them right because KiCAD threw me off by so much.

Total time: 
It took me the entire long weekend to do this.
